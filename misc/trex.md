## Useful PYTHIA notes
[Back to table of Contents](../README.md)

Purpose:

- Give a presentation in one of the most impactful conferences in the field of heavy-ion collisions
- Showcase new physics results from the laboratory
- Strengthen our position within the ALICE collaboration and CERN
- Expand my professional network (as an early-career scientist this is of uttermost importance, however my ability to do so has been impacted by Covid measures)
- Learn about cutting-edge research being done elsewhere that can be translated into novel future measurements.

Benefit:

- Showcasing new physics results from analyses led by LBNL physicists specifically and the USA physics community in general, to further establish a strong USA presence in the international physics community.
- Getting the international physics community interested and involved in the research done at LBNL which can attract future graduate students and postdocs to the laboratory.
- Developing professional relationships with theorists who can provide insights and theory predictions to be benchmarked with our measurement.
- Increase the visibility of our measurements at the conference level, which can correlate with increased citations in future LBNL publications.
- Gather comments that can influence and guide this and future LBNL studies.
