Open on an internet browser:
```
https://jupyter.nersc.gov/
```

log in with your usual credentials. In the window that opens, on the left-hand side one can navigate to where one wants to work, create directories, etcetera. On the right-hand side there are multiple options to initiate a jupyter notebook. If one needs to use pyROOT then one of the pyROOT options must be used.
